# Blog Posts

Welcome to my blog! Here, I share my thoughts, experiences, and reflections on my technical journey. This section will grow as I document my learning process, technical insights, and project developments.

## How to Add Blog Posts

### Creating a New Blog Post

To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `docs/blog-posts/` directory
2. Name the file descriptively, e.g., `git-branching.md`
3. Add proper frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: Your Blog Post Title
sidebar_label: Shorter Title for Sidebar
description: A brief description of what the post covers
---
```

### Structuring Your Blog Post

A well-structured blog post typically includes:

- A clear, engaging title
- An introduction that sets context
- Main content with appropriate headings (h2, h3, etc.)
- Images or diagrams to illustrate concepts
- Code examples where relevant
- A conclusion or summary
- Tags or categories (if applicable)

### Including Images in Blog Posts

Place images in the `static/img/` directory and reference them like this:

```markdown
![Alt text for your image](/img/your-image.png)
```

### Adding Code Samples

Use triple backticks with the language name for syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
